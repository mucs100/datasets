1365710646705283075	I just found out that the vaccine doesn‚Äôt prevent you from ever getting Covid. It merely stops you from getting so sick you need to go to the hospital IF you get it. Am I the only one that didn‚Äôt know that?! I thought it stopped you from getting it altogether. Damn üò≥ I feel dumb	0

1331930756021702656	In the time of Social Media and attention seeking, healthy people are getting tested for Covid and wearing a positive result result like a bloody badge.

1387089897517993986	@ClareCraigPath It's worse than that. Covid is NOT the actual cause of death in most instances. Just they tested positive within 28 days which is what I think you are getting at. In which case why do we all need a 'vaccine' &amp; be isolated for weeks at a time? This stinks!	0
1371828843040833539	Did I hear this correctly? Coach for the WNBA got his second dose of Covid vaccine and then one week later tested positive for Covid? We all need to slow down and give the vaccines a chance to work. Every time one of these anomalies happen it gets harder to fight the virus.	0

1372626185608302592	@BurgersAllday I don't know much, but vaccines protect against serious symptoms of COVID. Can still catch it and be contagious, but you won't need to be hospitalized. I'd say it's mostly risk abatement. Getting my second shot tomorrow. Will continue to mask up. (US case numbers heading up.)	0

1380128857408335872	@ReutersScience I agree with this. I had covid and was placed on oxygen and nebulisers, nothing would work and was admitted to hospital, a month later I suffered the worst mental break down of my life and couldn‚Äôt cope, strange to think that they‚Äôre connected.	1
1386490375091769346	@trying2help @mehdirhasan I had read that only hospital diagnosed deaths are being reported too. So if you are turned away from a hospital and pass, then cremated immediately (as families are being told to do), your death from Covid may never be recorded.	0
